This repository contains the code, data, and paper for a dual-task machine learning framework to predict startup success, focusing on venture capital funding (`has_VC`) and final status (`acquired` or `closed`). Leveraging a 923-sample Kaggle dataset, we explore key predictors like team networks and funding timelines, achieving top accuracies of 0.79 (KNN) for funding and 0.83 (Logistic Regression) for status.

## Overview

Startups face a high failure rate (>85% within five years), making predictive tools vital for entrepreneurs and investors. This project introduces a novel dual-task approach:
- **Task 1**: Predicts if a startup secures venture capital (`has_VC`) using a 120-sample subset.
- **Task 2**: Forecasts final status (`acquired` or `closed`) across the full dataset.

We employ Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression, with preprocessing via imputation, encoding, scaling, and feature selection (`SelectKBest`). Results highlight team strength (`relationships`) and milestones as key drivers, though Random Forestâ€™s perfect 1.0 status accuracy suggests potential overfitting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikranth3140/Startup-Success-Prediction.git
   cd Startup-Success-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Requires Python 3.6+.*

## Key Findings

- **VC Funding (`has_VC`)**:
  - KNN: 0.79 accuracy, 0.86 F1-score (negatives).
  - Top features: `relationships`, `age_last_funding_year`.
- **Status**:
  - Logistic Regression: 0.83 accuracy, balanced F1-scores (0.86 acquired, 0.77 closed).
  - Random Forest: 1.0 accuracy (needs validation).
- Insight: Funding boosts resources, but team and milestones drive long-term success.
